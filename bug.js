This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  Specifically, when setting `autoFocus` to 'off' and attempting to manually focus using `setFocusDepth`, the camera might not focus correctly, resulting in blurry images. The camera preview might appear to be focused, but the captured images are out of focus. This issue is intermittent and seems related to the interaction between the auto-focus setting and manual focus control.
